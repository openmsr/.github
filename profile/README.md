## openmsr

openmsr is a collection of open source repositories related to molten salt reactors.
contribution is welcome.

**historical molten salt reactor research documents**
- [msr-archive](https://github.com/openmsr/msr-archive)

**code development**
- [openmc](https://github.com/openmsr/openmc) a fork of the [openmc main branch](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc) with msr feature development.
- [pincell-msr](https://github.com/openmsr/pincell_msr) example case to demonstrate msr features in openmc.
- [CAD_to_OpenMC](https://github.com/openmsr/CAD_to_OpenMC) allows for meshed CAD geometries to be modeled in openmc.
- [OpenMC_To_Geant4](https://github.com/openmsr/OpenMC_To_Geant4) allows for charged particles and photo-nuclear reactions modeling in TOPAS/Geant4 based on openmc input.
- [msrDynamics](https://github.com/openmsr/msrDynamics) allows for dynamic point-kinetics and modified point-kinetics modeling of msr's using standard python libraries.
